On this page you can find documentation about how to classify sequences using NanoClass2 and do an OTU table analysis.

DNA was isolated from Winogradksy columns with wood or paper as substrate. For each substrate 3 independent columns were sampled and for each columns there are 3-4 replicates. 
DNA was sampled on two days, by two different groups of students (i.e. Practical_groups 1 and 2):
