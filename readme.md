# Example code repository

The goal of this repository is to provide an example for how to document code and use git for version control.

## Project description

NanoClass2 was used to classify 16S rRNA amplicon sequences from 21 samples. DNA samples were taken from Winogradksy columns with wood or paper as substrate. For each substrate 3 independent columns were sampled and for each columns there are 3-4 replicates. DNA was sampled on two days, by two different groups of students (i.e. Practical_groups 1 and 2):
